        <h3>Our Audience:</h3>
        <p>Friends and families alike can turn to the Bountiful Foods website to order the best shakes in church town.
            Bountiful Food's main demographics are suburban moms in their 30's or 40's who want to pick up the occasional drink.
            It shouldn't be too expensive, but they are bougie and want it to be slightly expensive. For the website we will 
            focus on college students as they are most likely to view our website.
